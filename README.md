## Introduction
ToneSense is a web app that allows a user to enter in a sentence and receive a sentiment analysis result from a Machine Learning Model. The ML model will return a numbered score and magnitude which represents the sentence's sentiment on a scale of likely positive, likely neutral, or likely negative. 

This project was built in two separate and distinct parts - *Version 1* and *Version 2*. Explained in more detail below.

## Version 1
This version utilizes the Google Cloud NLP API to analyze the user's sentence and return a sentiment analysis result. The web app is built with React and React-Bootstrap and uses Axios to make calls to the back end Flask API (version 1 as well).
